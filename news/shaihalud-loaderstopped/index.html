        <p>Shai-Halud, A worm implanted from NPM, made its way into our package.json file. It added the malicous script without devs knowing and caused 1,000s of .env keys, emails, usernames, credit cards and phone numbers to be leaked. Because of this, we had to shut down the loader before anything got too crazy. Hence why we added that README.MD update. The remaning data leaks have been removed by github including ours. There should be no more problems going foward.</p>
